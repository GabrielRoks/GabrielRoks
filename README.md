# Gabriel Roks

Backend Developer with experience in Node.js, and REST API architecture. I have worked on building scalable systems, integrations, relational database structures, and applications focused on performance and clean code organization.

I have contributed to projects involving:
- Backend development from scratch, including architecture, database modeling, and service structure.
- Creation of REST APIs and integrations with external services.
- Implementation of authentication, authorization, and security best practices.
- Use of patterns such as MVC, Clean Architecture, and Domain-Driven Design.
- Personal projects and real-world client solutions, including service platforms and internal tools.

I am always looking to learn new technologies and improve my skills in the backend ecosystem.
